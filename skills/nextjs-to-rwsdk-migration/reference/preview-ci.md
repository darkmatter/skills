# Per-PR preview CI

Two workflows that turn every PR into a live, browser-testable preview. Reuses the existing `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` + `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` repo secrets — no new credentials.

            ### 🚀 RedwoodSDK preview deployed

            | Stack | Stage | URL |
            | ----- | ----- | --- |
            | `${{ github.repository }}` | `pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` | ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.preview_url }} |

            The preview is rebuilt on every push. It's destroyed when the PR closes.

            <sub>Built with Alchemy + RedwoodSDK · ${{ github.sha }}</sub>
```

Key bits:

- `permissions: pull-requests: write` is required for the sticky comment. GitHub silently drops the comment if missing.
- `concurrency: cancel-in-progress` kills the old deploy when a new push lands. Saves runner minutes; avoids race conditions with the state store.
- The URL parser greps for `*.workers.dev` because alchemy's structured output isn't stable yet.
- Smoke test uses curl, not playwright — playwright is for ad-hoc human verification of complex routes.

      - name: Comment on PR
        uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
        with:
          header: rwsdk-preview
          message: |
            ### 🧹 RedwoodSDK preview destroyed

            Stage `pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` removed.
```

Same `header: rwsdk-preview` so the cleanup message replaces the deploy message on the PR (sticky comments are keyed by header).

## Trying it locally first

Before opening a draft PR, kick the deploy manually for your dev stage:

```bash
bun run build
bun alchemy deploy ./alchemy.run.ts --stage dev --yes
```

If that succeeds, the CI path will too. The most common cause of CI-only failures is an unrelated env var the workflow doesn't pass — diff the env in the workflow against your local `.env.local` to find it.

---

## Production deploy stays separate

The merge-to-main production deploy lives in a separate `alchemy-deploy.yml` and runs on `push` to `main`, not on PRs. Don't merge it into the preview workflow — production needs different secrets, different concurrency, and a different stage name.

---

## Cost: ~free

Each PR preview is a single Cloudflare Worker bound to the assets static-deploy. Workers' free tier covers 100k req/day; sticky preview comments live in GitHub. The only real cost is the few cents per minute of runner time per push, and Cloudflare worker upload metadata.
