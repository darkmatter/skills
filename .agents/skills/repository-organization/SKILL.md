description: Organize darkmatter repositories, READMEs, agent context, docs, scripts, skills, and ADRs into the right durable locations. Triggers when deciding where something belongs, restructuring repo layout, adding always-follow rules, or documenting architectural decisions. Do NOT trigger for Nix flake-specific layout work; use nix-flake-organization instead.

# Repository organization

Keep each repository easy for humans and agents to navigate by putting durable context, reusable guidance, automation, and decisions in the right layer. Prefer the smallest durable home that will be loaded at the time it matters.

## When to use

- A user asks where to put a new instruction, convention, policy, skill, command, script, workflow, reference doc, or ADR.
- A repo is accumulating scattered Markdown, duplicated agent instructions, or ad hoc decision notes.
- A change introduces a naming, layout, vendor, architecture, security, deployment, or process decision that future contributors should not re-litigate.
- A README is being created, reorganized, or reviewed for standard structure.
- A user asks whether something belongs in `AGENTS.md`, `.agent/context/`, `.agent/policy/`, `.agent/workflows/`, `skills/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, or `presets/`.
- A project is being bootstrapped from the darkmatter template and needs its local context filled in cleanly.

## When NOT to use

- The task is specifically reorganizing Nix flakes, flake-parts outputs, NixOS modules, nix-darwin modules, or Home Manager modules. Use `nix-flake-organization`.
- The user only asks to create or edit a team-wide skill. Use `dm-skill-creator`; layer this skill only for placement or ADR questions around that change.
- The user is asking for one-off implementation notes that do not need to survive beyond the current task.
- The repository already has a clear local convention that conflicts with this guidance and the user explicitly wants to preserve it. Follow the local convention and note the tradeoff.

## Placement rules

Start from the question: who needs this, when do they need it, and does it need to be enforced or merely discoverable?

The root `README.md` "Where to put what" table is the canonical placement table for this repo. This table is a task-focused summary for agents applying that policy.

| Need                                            | Put it here                          | Why                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Org-wide rule every agent must follow           | `presets/base/AGENTS.md`             | Always loaded; keep it short and high-signal.                          |
| Project entrypoint for agents                   | Root `AGENTS.md` plus provider shims | Lets tools find the canonical project context.                         |
| Durable project facts and decisions             | `.agent/context/`                    | Always loaded inside that project; use for what is true now.           |
| Mandatory project policy, gates, and exceptions | `.agent/policy/`                     | Enforceable project-local rules and approved deviations.               |
| Recurring project procedure                     | `.agent/workflows/`                  | Stable step-by-step task flow.                                         |
| Project-local reusable capability               | `.agent/skills/`                     | Only useful in that project.                                           |
| Team-wide reusable capability                   | `skills/<name>/`                     | Useful across multiple darkmatter projects; add `docs/catalog.md` row. |
| Long skill examples or lookup material          | `skills/<name>/reference/`           | Loaded only after the skill points there.                              |
| Per-language convention exemplar code           | `references/<language>/`             | Reference codebase read from the repo checkout; prose stays in skills. |
| Skill-owned deterministic helper                | `skills/<name>/scripts/`             | Travels with the skill through the Home Manager module.                |
| Repo maintenance automation                     | Top-level `scripts/`                 | Run from this repo; not auto-discovered by clients.                    |
| Human-readable shared-skill inventory           | `docs/catalog.md`                    | Teammates skim it before adding or choosing skills.                    |
| OpenCode slash command                          | `presets/opencode/commands/`         | User controls invocation timing.                                       |
| OpenCode lifecycle hook or integration          | `presets/opencode/plugins/`          | Event-driven runtime behavior.                                         |
| Model-callable deterministic function           | `presets/opencode/tools/`            | Structured tool result, not prose instructions.                        |
| OpenCode specialist agent definition            | `presets/opencode/agents/`           | Role-specific agent behavior and permissions.                          |

Prefer one canonical copy plus shims or links. If two files say the same thing, one of them will drift.

## README standard

Repository READMEs must follow Standard Readme: `https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/blob/main/spec.md`.

Apply the standard when creating or editing `README.md` files:

1. Use `README.md` capitalization for Markdown READMEs. For translated READMEs, use BCP 47 language tags such as `README.de.md`; reserve `README.md` for English when multiple languages exist.
2. Make the title match the repository, folder, and package-manager names, or explain any mismatch in the long description.
3. Keep Standard Readme section order and exact section titles unless translating the README. Required sections include title, short description, contributing, and license; install and usage are required by default unless the repo is documentation-only.
4. Keep the short description on its own line, under 120 characters, and not formatted as a blockquote.
5. Include a table of contents for READMEs longer than 100 lines. It should link to all sections, capture at least all level-two headings, and start with the next section after the table of contents.
6. Keep links working, lint code examples the same way the project lints source code, and keep the license section last.
7. Use `standard-readme-preset` (`https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme-preset`) for remark-based linting when adding README checks.
8. Use `generator-standard-readme` (`https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme`) when scaffolding a new README from scratch.

## ADR guidance

Use ADRs for decisions that cross-cut multiple skills, multiple teammates, or future work. In this repo, ADR conventions live in `docs/adr/README.md`; do not invent a parallel template inside a skill.

Write an ADR when the decision is durable and cross-cutting; skip ADRs for local implementation notes, ephemeral state, and project-local decisions that belong in `.agent/context/decisions.md`. Treat `docs/adr/README.md` as authoritative for the full write/do-not-write criteria.

When adding or updating ADRs:

1. Read `docs/adr/README.md` or the target project's ADR README first.
2. Use the next zero-padded number and a kebab-case title.
3. Keep the decision to one topic with context, decision, consequences, and alternatives considered.
4. Use `proposed` while under review; mark `accepted` only when the decision is real.
5. Treat accepted ADRs as append-mostly history. If the decision changes, create a new ADR and mark the old one `superseded by ADR-XXXX`.
6. Link the ADR from the README, catalog, code comment, PR, or docs section where future readers will hit the governed behavior.

## Organization workflow

1. Inventory existing conventions before moving anything: root README, `AGENTS.md`, `.agent/`, `docs/`, `skills/`, `scripts/`, `presets/`, and ADRs.
2. Identify the artifact type: always-on rule, project fact, policy, workflow, reusable skill, command, plugin, tool, script, reference doc, or decision.
3. Choose the narrowest durable home from the placement table.
4. Preserve public entrypoints and compatibility shims unless the user explicitly approves a breaking cleanup.
5. Move one concern at a time and update links in the same change.
6. If a decision explains the new structure, add or update the ADR before claiming the structure is settled.
7. Verify with repo-specific checks plus targeted searches for stale paths, duplicate guidance, and outdated catalog rows.

## Common mistakes

- Putting always-follow policy in an on-demand skill; agents might not load it.
- Turning a skill into a junk drawer for project-specific state.
- Storing project facts in global presets where they leak into unrelated repos.
- Writing ADRs for unresolved debates instead of marking them `proposed` or keeping them in a planning doc.
- Editing accepted ADR conclusions in place instead of superseding them.
- Moving files without updating provider shims, catalog entries, README tables, or internal links.
- Adding scripts under a skill when they are really repo maintenance helpers, or vice versa.

## Review checklist

- The artifact lives at the layer where consumers will actually load it.
- Always-on context stayed short; detail moved to skills, workflows, reference docs, or ADRs.
- README changes follow Standard Readme naming, section order, required sections, link hygiene, and code-example linting.
- Project-local facts did not leak into team-wide skills or global presets.
- Team-wide skills have `SKILL.md` frontmatter, a catalog row, and validation coverage.
- ADR-worthy decisions are recorded or intentionally deferred with a clear reason.
- Accepted ADRs are not silently rewritten; supersession chains are explicit.
- Links, shims, catalog rows, and examples still point at the new paths.

## Tools

None. This is a pure prompt and review skill. Use repo-local validators and search commands for verification.

## Reference

- `docs/adr/README.md` in this repo owns ADR format and lifecycle conventions.
- `README.md` in this repo contains the current "Where to put what" table for shared infrastructure.
- `docs/opencode-layout.md` maps OpenCode install targets to source paths.
- `template/.agent/README.md` describes the project-local `.agent/` layout.
